## What is Smarty Pants? 

SmartyPants is driven by a shared motivation - to level the playing field in education. We recognize the significant disparity caused by the booming tuition industry, where those from affluent backgrounds are able to afford specialised supplementary classes. This creates a glaring inequality in access to quality education. To address this issue head-on, we are committed to providing tailored and affordable resources to students. Our mission is to empower every individual with the tools they need to unlock their full potential, ensuring equal opportunities for all.

SmartyPants harnesses the advanced intelligence of ChatGPT to revolutionise personalised learning. It offers a range of features including tailored exam papers, immediate answers, and valuable insights for users. With an intuitive and user-friendly interface, navigating through the app becomes a seamless and enjoyable experience.

Leveraging the LangChain framework and employing prompt engineering techniques, we developed a robust system to generate tailored results. 

Our first standout feature is the ability to use our GUI to gain answers immediately. Our app is the ultimate one-stop shop for all your queries, offering a seamless and efficient experience.

That's not all! Imagine effortlessly generating unique exam papers tailored to your needs. SmartyPants is able to take any worksheets or exam papers and professionally transform them into a downloadable exam paper.

But that's just the beginning. Our app goes above and beyond by providing invaluable insights that revolutionize the way you comprehend information. Through the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP), our app generates concise summaries of any uploaded PDF document, making comprehension effortless. 

Not only that, SmartyPants equips you with automatically generated mind maps, showcasing the main topics covered in your materials. Furthermore, with SmartyPants, you have the flexibility to query and analyse various document formats - PDFs, Excel sheets, CSV files - all within our innovative GUI. 

Say goodbye to superficial skimming and embrace a comprehensive understanding with our cutting-edge solution.
